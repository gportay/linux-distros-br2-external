linux-distros-br2-external is a Buildroot br2-external tree to generate
Linux Desktop systems through distribution pre-built packages.

Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

0) run 'git clone https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot'
1) run 'make -C buildroot menuconfig BR2_EXTERNAL=$PWD'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make -C buildroot'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in buildroot/output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!
