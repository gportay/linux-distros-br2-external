	  Allow root to log in with a password.

	  If not enabled, root will not be able to log in with a
	  password. However, if you have an ssh server and you add an
	  ssh key, you can still allow root to log in. Alternatively,
	  you can use sudo to become root.

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD
	string "Root password"
	default ""
	depends on BR2_TARGET_ENABLE_ROOT_LOGIN
	help
	  Set the initial root password.

	  If set to empty (the default), then no root password will be
	  set, and root will need no password to log in.

	  If the password starts with any of $1$, $5$ or $6$, it is
	  considered to be already crypt-encoded with respectively md5,
	  sha256 or sha512.  Any other value is taken to be a clear-text
	  value, and is crypt-encoded as per the "Passwords encoding"
	  scheme, above.

	  Note: "$" signs in the hashed password must be doubled. For
	  example, if the hashed password is
	  "$1$longsalt$v35DIIeMo4yUfI23yditq0", then you must enter it
	  as "$$1$$longsalt$$v35DIIeMo4yUfI23yditq0" (this is necessary
	  otherwise make would attempt to interpret the $ as a variable
	  expansion).

	  WARNING! WARNING!
	  The password appears as-is in the .config file, and may appear
	  in the build log! Avoid using a valuable password if either
	  the .config file or the build log may be distributed, or at
	  the very least use a strong cryptographic hash for your
	  password!

config BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_REMOUNT_ROOTFS_RW
	bool "remount root filesystem read-write during boot"
	default y
	help
	  The root filesystem is typically mounted read-only at boot.
	  By default, buildroot remounts it in read-write mode early
	  during the boot process.
	  Say no here if you would rather like your root filesystem to
	  remain read-only.
	  If unsure, say Y.

	  If left empty, no automatic DHCP requests will take place.

	  For more complicated network setups use an overlay to
	  overwrite /etc/network/interfaces or add a networkd
